# Shylock Finance

## 1. Introduction

Shylock Finance is a DeFi project that aims to provide cross-chain lending and borrowing. While it uses base system of Compound Protocol, its uniqueness lies in the fact that it offers an under-collateralized loan system. This means that users can borrow more than the value of their collateral. This is made possible by the use of a credit score system and DAO the user belongs to.

The project is built to be cross-chain compatible using CCIP(Cross-Chain Interoperability Protocol) of Chainlink. This means that users can borrow and lend assets from different blockchains. The project is built on the Avalanche C-Chain(Fuji) and Ethereum(Sepolia) and will be expanded to other blockchains in the future.

**What is Shylock?**

The name "Shylock" is derived from a character in William Shakespeare's play "The Merchant of Venice." In the play, Shylock is a complex character, known for his role as a moneylender who charges high interests. He is often remembered for his strict adherence to the letter of the law and his insistence on the enforcement of a bond.

In the context of Shylock Finance, the name has been chosen to reflect a deep understanding and a nuanced approach to lending and borrowing in the world of decentralized finance (DeFi). Just as Shylock in the play represents the concept of lending with strict terms, Shylock Finance embodies a new era of lending protocols where the focus is on innovative and flexible lending solutions. Unlike the character, however, Shylock Finance aims to foster a more equitable and accessible financial ecosystem. The utilization of a credit score system and DAO memberships for under-collateralized loans showcases a commitment to modernizing lending practices while ensuring security and trust in the DeFi space.

Thus, "Shylock" in the context of our project is symbolic of a transformation in lending – moving from the rigid and often punitive practices of the past to a more inclusive, innovative, and user-friendly approach that leverages the latest in blockchain technology.
